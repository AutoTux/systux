## Command line software.

### Sometimes it is necessary to reformat your Linux operating system and reinstall various packages. This script is designed to simplify this process by allowing you to save a list of these packages to a portable SQLite database. That way, you can even store that list on a USB stick, run the commands to reinstall those packages on your machine, and store the script along with the database in a convenient location for future use.



## Instalation:

    pip install systux

## usage

    systux -h
